	/// <summary>
	///     Creates and returns a new database connection instance.
	/// </summary>
	/// <returns>
	///     A new instance of <see cref="IDbConnection" /> that provides access to the database.
	///     The caller is responsible for properly disposing the connection when finished.
	/// </returns>
	/// <remarks>
	///     Each call to this method creates a new connection that must be disposed. It is recommended to wrap
	///     the connection in a using statement or using declaration to ensure proper resource cleanup.
	/// </remarks>
	/// <example>
	///     <code>
	/// 	 using (var connection = dbContext.DbConnection())
	/// 	 {
	/// 		 // Use the connection here
	/// 	 } // Connection is automatically disposed
	/// 	 </code>
	/// </example>
	IDbConnection DbConnection();
